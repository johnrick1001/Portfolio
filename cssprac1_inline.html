    <h1 style="color:red; font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">A LIST OF LISTS</h1>

    <p style="color:navy; font-family:'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif;">
        Lists of the best, the worst, the most popular, and the funniest are all over the Web. 
        Here are some of our favorites.
    </p>

    <h2>Most Wanted</h2>
    <p style="color:navy; font-family:'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif;">
        Mugs from the <i>FBI's list of 10 most wanted fugitives</i> are always available here. 
        Two years ago, comic-strip detective Dick Tracy joined the hunt and published profiles 
        from the list, including one of Osama bin Laden: "Thin, walks with a cane," it said.

    <h2>The Lycos 50</h2>
    <p style="color:navy; font-family:'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif;">
        Who is hot and who is not in online searches? When we checked, Osama bin Laden 
        and <i>Martha Stewart</i> were on the decline, while Christmas and Harry Potter were 
        ascending on the list of most popular search terms at the Lycos service.

    <h2>List Universe</h2>
    <p style="color:navy; font-family:'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif;">
        E-mail lists are Internet communities that share e-mail messages on any subject 
        imaginable – and some that aren't. List Universe is for anyone trying to set up a list, or 
        to keep one going. It gives tips on promoting a list, selling advertising for e-zines, and 
        writing for an online audience.
