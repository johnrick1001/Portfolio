    <p>Still thinking of a summer vacation? Better get a move on. We scanned the Web for some 
       of the more unusual vacation ideas out there. And some are really out there.</p>

    <h2>Dolphin Encounters</h2>
    <p>Want to commune with intelligent beings from another world? Try swimming with dolphins.

    <h2>The Skydivin' Place</h2>
    <p>Take a skydiving vacation. This Maryland skydiving company has rigged its home page to 
       play a pinging rendition of the Tom Petty song Free Fallin'. Cute.</p>
